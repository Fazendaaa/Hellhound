Welcome to Fazendaaa's {{ pkg.name }}. This is version {{ pkg.version }}!

Made with:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Ideia

Currently, in the company that I work for we have a CLI (Command Line Interface) made in [Python](https://www.python.org/) called `estat` that you can read more about it right [here](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/Succubus). As the CLI tool as many commands and features, one of them being able to set "recipes" for projects, the ideia behind {{ pkg.name }} is to have a marketplace to share thoses recipes to be used between many people and projects.

As `estat` have grown so much and making it available as FOSS (Free and open-source software) was always the idea but the project still in development and not having a properly defined scope, I decided to break its main features in other projects:

- [Succubus](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/Succubus): universal package manager based on cloud-native
- [Jinn](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/Jinn): universal project manager built to expand Succubus capabilities
- [Baba Yaga](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/BabaYaga): universal cloud-native manager built to expand Jinn and Succubus capabilities
- [Wendigo](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/Wendigo): universal project translator from cloud-native projects to other infra technologies
- [Shōjō](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/Shojo): LaTex package manager
- [Hellhound](github.com/Fazendaaa/Hellhound): VSCode extension to integrate Jinn recipes

## Installing
